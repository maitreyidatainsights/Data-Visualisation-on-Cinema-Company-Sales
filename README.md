This project focuses on customer data collected from a UK-wide cinema chain. The dataset includes averaged insights gathered over a four-year period, with each cinema identified by a unique three-letter code. Various visualizations have been created to explore patterns, trends, and relationships within the dataset. Effective data visualization enables businesses to quickly convey insights, forecast trends, improve stakeholder engagement, and identify key areas for strategic improvement. Whether itâ€™s estimating sales, evaluating performance across regions, or analyzing consumer behavior, visual tools like bar charts, scatter plots, pie charts, and clustering methods help bring clarity and structure to the data.
